# Internet

## Introduction to the Internet
A network is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other. All these networks when connected together form the internet.

## How the Internet Works: An Overview
At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

In addition to these core protocols, there are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology
- Packet: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
- Router: A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
- IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.
- Domain Name: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.
- DNS: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
- HTTPS: An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
- SSL/TLS: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.
